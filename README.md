# rvst_synth

A crate for organizing synthesizers for [vst2](https://github.com/overdrivenpotato/rust-vst2) and [easyvst](https://github.com/Boscop/easyvst).  Inspired by JUCE's API.

Provides a very lightweight `Synthesizer` structure, with many voices.  Once a `Voice` trait is implemented, it can be used easily from the `Synthesizer` manager.
